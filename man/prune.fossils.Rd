\title{Removes all intermediate fossils from a combined tree and labels the first and last fossils of each lineage.
Can be used with sampled or complete trees. If only one fossil is present for a particular species it is labeled as first.}
\usage{
prune.fossils(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{Combined tree with fossils.}
}
\value{
Tree with pruned fossils.
}
\description{
Removes all intermediate fossils from a combined tree and labels the first and last fossils of each lineage.
Can be used with sampled or complete trees. If only one fossil is present for a particular species it is labeled as first.
