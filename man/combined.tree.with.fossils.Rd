\title{Transforms a tree and fossils dataframe to a combined format.
Sampled ancestors are represented as tips on zero-length edges to maintain compatibility with the ape format.}
\usage{
combined.tree.with.fossils(tree, fossils)

\arguments{
\item{tree}{Phylo object.}

\item{fossils}{Fossils object.}
}
\value{
A tree integrating the fossils.

\description{
Transforms a tree and fossils dataframe to a combined format.
Sampled ancestors are represented as tips on zero-length edges to maintain compatibility with the ape format.

\examples{
# simulate tree
t<-ape::rtree(6)
# simulate fossils
f<-sim.fossils.poisson(t, 2)
# transform format
t2 = combined.tree.with.fossils(t,f)
